# my-awesome-vimrc

This vimrc has been curated and grown for years. There are sources from multiple authors including myself on this repo. Thanks to you all.

To install the plugins open VIM and type:

```
:VundleUpdate
```

It will update all plugins and install the ones missing.

Feel free to contribute to turn this repo to a reference on VIM scripting :D
